      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the day one&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: the day in which I&amp;rsquo;m finally kickstarting my personal
website. &lt;br /&gt;
The day zero lasts for many years: looking at its whois records I discovered that
I bought this domain name in the far 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ whois tosatto.me
Domain Name: TOSATTO.ME
WHOIS Server:
Referral URL: www.namecheap.com
Updated Date: 2016-08-19T22:50:17Z

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time I was 21 years old, still at University, spending most of the time hacking
exams and code with my incredible colleagues and wondering what I would have been
in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it came 2012, my third year of University. I was deep in programming languages
and concurrency theory and writing my bachelor thesis,
&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Type for Leak Detection in a Session-Oriented Functional Programming Language&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.
I was really having fun with such kind of strange topics.
So much that it finally came the first opportunity to use the domain
name I had bought the year before:
I needed to publish somewhere on the web my thesis to
support my candidature for a student grants
to cover the expenses to attend &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://popl.mpi-sws.org/2013/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;POPL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,
a very huge conference on programming languages theory in Rome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t won the prize so I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to POPL, but this
is what my website was looking like at that time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://tosatto.me/img/posts/day-one/tosatto.me.png&#34; alt=&#34;tosatto.me - bachelor degree dissertation&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
        tosatto.me - bachelor degree dissertation
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yes. It was utterly ugly, but it was temporary, just for few weeks: all
the important information was there, included a super-short presentation of
my work. This was my plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my website has been exactly like that until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;2016&lt;/strong&gt;. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know what I will be in my future like in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;
But finally I&amp;rsquo;ve got a real brand new website!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
